# electro - Electronic Store Application

My final project from CodersLab bootcamp.

Simple web shop application with basic features (login/register, creating orders, payment, managing orders and user etc.)

You can preview this application on [heroku](https://electro-shop-app.herokuapp.com/).
Application needs time to deploy and to access remote db so a little bit of patience is advised.
